# Changelog

## Unreleased
- `.mcp.json` wired a third-party `grok-cli-mcp` server instead of this one; its
  draft-04 schemas made hosts fail every request after loading a tool
- Project-scoped entry now resolves the package via `CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR` (no
  working-directory assumption) and takes the interpreter from `${GROK_MCP_PYTHON:-py}`
- `tests/test_tool_schemas.py` guards draft 2020-12 conformance of every tool schema
- `install.ps1` writes Claude/Cursor snippets, matching `install.sh`
- Corrected stale server version and tool counts in README and Codex setup readback

## 0.8.0 — Session Protocol v1.2 Navigator
- `*_session_next` returns one action card (host_cmd|mcp_tool|end)
- Host loop: begin → next* → end (minimal tokens)
- Skill v1.0.0 enforces navigator-only protocol
- Install/update/feedback cards without empty plans

## 0.7.0 — Session Protocol v1.1
- Plan compiler + budget guard
